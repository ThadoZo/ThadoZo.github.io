## ThadoZo Linguist and History Researchers


**ABOUT**
ThadoZo is a small team of Linguist and History enthusiasts who are a part of Zou Literature Society where we work on Unicode/Uniscribe of Zoese.
         Where the aim is to adapt Zolai into a more Modern appealing and Update it to the current generation.

**GOAL**

To rebrand Chin-Kuki-Mizo from Zo to Zoese.
To teach young Zoese of History, Language and Philosophy.


**WHAT IS ZOESE?**

Zoese is the name of the combination of Chin­Kuki­Mizo, it is also the umbrella of all Dialects such as Thadou, Mizo, Paite, Vaiphei, etc. But among us, Zo has been
misunderstood by different community group inside the Zo himself. Which is why to break the confusion when naming a community, all important points are
made below.


To rebrand Chin­Kuki­Mizo/Zo as a modern ethnolinguistic identity for international
use with the ­ese suffix, Zo people referring to all Chin­Kuki­Mizo should be standardized as
Zoese because:


1.) It unifies pronunciation and make it clears to whom they refers to.


2.) It gains instant recognition in global discourse like “Burmese,” which directly links to
Myanmar without ambiguity or English, which links to British.


3.) It adapts well in translation, diplomacy, and academia as it's flexible to use with less
confusions.


4.) It avoids clan­level confusion, as the ­nese form represents the whole Chin­Kuki­Mizo
identity, not just one subgroup such as Zomi or Zou.



TO BREAK INTERNAL CONFUSION


1.) Outsiders cannot tell if Thadou is Zo or not because of their rivalry with Zomi, especially in
regions where Kuki or Zomi dominate local identity supported by our recent interviews and
survey from Molnom, Songgel to Bizang where we confirmed that 8 out of 10 men agreed they
do not like the word Zo all of them being 17­25 of ages.


2.) Insiders exploit these terms politically, deepening divides.


3.) In academic writings like MIL, “Zo” is sometimes mistaken as referring to only one clan Zou
and made a different language from Paite and Thadou which are supposed to be Dialects as
according to ISO 639 and Ethnologue.


By saying Zoese, we create a neutral umbrella term carrying the same pride as “I’m
Thadou,” “I’m Mizo,” or “I’m Hakha,” yet without suggesting that one subgroup overshadows the
rest or that Mizo and Thadou are different lineage.
This is a necessary step as “Zo” is the combination of Chin­Kuki­Mizo, but “­ese” refines it,
removes confusion, and unites all under one name just as Japanese comes from Nihon, and
Vietnamese from Viet Nam or Igorot, Negrito, and Lumad coming under Fillipinos.


**ACHIEVEMENTS**

We have succeded in making Zoese more available to the public of younger Eimi through Youtube by co-operating with a Fillipino named Andy.

Another Achievement is the making of the Uniscribe of Zoese for Computer to use making it easier to standerlized it to modern implication.
